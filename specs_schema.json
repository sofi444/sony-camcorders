{
    "Lens/Zoom": {
        "Focal Length (35mm Equivalent)": "Indicates the lens’s angle of view, comparing it to a traditional 35mm camera. A shorter focal length gives a wide-angle view, ideal for capturing landscapes, while a longer focal length zooms in on distant subjects, useful for close-ups and telephoto shots. This determines how much of the scene you can capture and how close you appear to your subject.",
        "Aperture (F-stop)": "Describes the lens's light-gathering ability. Lower f-stop values (e.g., f/1.8) let in more light, improving performance in low light and creating a background blur effect (bokeh) for portraits. Higher f-stop values provide deeper focus, keeping more of the scene sharp.",
        "Lens Type": "Specifies the lens brand or technology (e.g., ZEISS®, Sony G). High-quality lenses improve image sharpness, color accuracy, and reduce distortion, impacting overall image quality and making colors more natural and scenes clearer.",
        "Optical Zoom": "The camera’s capability to zoom in on a subject by physically adjusting the lens. Unlike digital zoom, optical zoom preserves image quality, making it ideal for detailed shots of faraway subjects.",
        "Digital Zoom": "A zoom that enlarges the image digitally instead of using lens movement. This may reduce image quality since the camera crops and scales up the image, which is suitable for casual use but not for high-detail shots.",
        "Clear Image Zoom": "A type of digital zoom that uses advanced processing to retain better image quality than standard digital zoom, allowing more zoom without significantly losing clarity."
    },
    "Camera": {
        "Sensor Type": "The technology behind the image sensor (e.g., CMOS, Exmor R). Different sensor types affect light sensitivity and image quality, particularly in low light, with some sensors performing better in dim conditions.",
        "Sensor Size": "The actual dimensions of the sensor. Larger sensors capture more light, which improves quality in low light and allows for a background blur effect, making subjects stand out sharply.",
        "Effective Pixels (Photo)": "The number of pixels used for taking still photos. More pixels generally mean higher resolution, capturing finer details for sharper, clearer images.",
        "Effective Pixels (Video)": "The number of pixels used specifically for video recording. A higher count generally results in more detailed video footage, allowing for a clearer, crisper picture.",
        "Image Stabilization": "Helps reduce blurriness from camera movement, making handheld shots smoother. Optical stabilization moves parts of the lens to compensate, while digital stabilization adjusts electronically. This is especially useful for action shots or filming while moving.",
        "Minimum Illumination": "The lowest light level at which the camera can still capture clear footage, measured in lux (e.g., 1 lux). Lower values indicate better performance in low-light environments, reducing the need for additional lighting.",
        "Manual Control Features": "Refers to the ability to manually adjust settings like focus, exposure, and aperture. This allows for creative control, enabling precise adjustments for different scenes and effects."
    },
    "Video": {
        "Frame Rate Options": "Describes the number of frames captured per second, indicated in fps (e.g., 24p, 60p). Common options include cinematic 24 fps, standard 30 fps, and smooth 60 fps for action scenes. “Progressive” (p) captures each frame fully, resulting in clearer motion, while “Interlaced” (i) alternates lines to create a smoother look but with slightly less detail.",
        "Video Resolution": "The pixel dimensions of each video frame, such as 1920x1080 (Full HD) or 3840x2160 (4K). Higher resolutions provide sharper detail, especially noticeable on larger screens.",
        "Recording Format": "The file format used to save videos (e.g., MP4, AVCHD). This affects file size, quality, and compatibility with editing software, with some formats better suited for specific uses.",
        "Bit Rate": "Measures the data processed per second in a video file, shown in Mbps. Higher bit rates typically offer better quality but larger file sizes, affecting storage needs and playback smoothness.",
        "HDR Recording": "High Dynamic Range recording captures a wider range between light and dark areas, enhancing contrast and colors for more realistic, vivid scenes."
    },
    "Screen": {
        "Screen Type": "The type of display used (e.g., LCD, OLED), impacting brightness, color accuracy, and viewing angles. OLED screens often have more vibrant colors and wider viewing angles than LCDs.",
        "Brightness Adjustment": "Allows you to adjust screen brightness, essential for visibility in bright or low light environments.",
        "Touch Screen": "Indicates if the screen responds to touch, enabling intuitive control over settings and focus by tapping directly on the display.",
        "Viewfinder": "An eyepiece for composing shots, useful in bright light where the screen may be hard to see. It also offers a stable shooting position for steadier footage."
    },
    "Audio": {
        "Built-in Microphone Type": "Describes the microphone’s design (e.g., stereo, zoom mic), affecting sound capture quality and direction. Stereo mics capture immersive sound, while zoom mics focus on sounds from a distance.",
        "Built-in Speaker": "Allows audio playback directly from the camcorder, convenient for reviewing footage with sound.",
        "External Mic Input": "A port for connecting an external microphone, enhancing audio quality by allowing the use of specialized mics for different recording environments.",
        "Manual Audio Control": "Allows manual adjustment of audio levels, essential for preventing distortion in changing sound conditions and achieving balanced audio."
